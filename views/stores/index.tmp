<?php echo $this->Html->img('market_.png', array('align' => 'right', 'class' => 'contentimg')); ?>The United States Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), historically and commonly known as the Food Stamp Program, is a federal-assistance program that provides assistance to low- and no-income people and families living in the U.S. Though the program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, benefits are distributed by the individual U.S. states.

<br /><br />
<?php echo $this->Html->img('iphone_.png', array('align' => 'left', 'class' => 'contentimg')); ?>Text your street address to <b>267-293-9387</b> and receive the nearest Farmers Market address, dates of operation and hours, the closet two SNAP-participating retailers, and information on how to maximize your SNAP dollars through local fresh food initiatives.

<br /><br />
Did you know most of Philadelphia's Farmer's Market accept SNAP
benefits for payment? Many of Philadelphia's Farmers' Markets even
give out additional bonus coupons for SNAP spending in their markets.

<br /><br />
Giving Philadelphians the information to spend SNAP benefits at local
fresh markets brings healthy food to our tables and supports local
businesses and farms.
